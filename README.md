# UnitTestPatterns

Project targets knowledge of useful Unit Test patterns.

I've started with https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5772/Advanced-Unit-Test-Part-V-Unit-Test-Patterns and https://www.manning.com/books/the-art-of-unit-testing-second-edition.
I wanted to have clear guide with code examples to explain what are good practices with unit tests in C# (and probably not only C#), based on code examples.

Object types, created from ground up, to show what is the purpose of those and what are their expected behaviour:
* Mocks
* Stubs

Unit Test classes patterns:
* Template Test Method
* Simple Data I/O tests
* State with rollback Tests
* Service Simulation
